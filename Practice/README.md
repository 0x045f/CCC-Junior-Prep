# Final Assesment
> This is the final practice before the actual ccc!

> There will be 3 contests that I will be explaining about, each with 5 questions and they are all on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/)

> I won't gurantee that I will implement the solutions in all 3 languages, I will probably only implement Java and C++, but I'll try to do a bit of python

> The contest links will be provided in each folder

> The rules will also be provided by the links

> ## Good Luck!
