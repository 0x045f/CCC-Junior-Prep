# Analysis
> though we haven't really learned brute force yet, you can understand the problem this way:   
> just loop through all possible triples and find the ones where the median is equal to x    
> go check out lesson 8 for more information on brute force

> ## Time Complexity
>> Going through all possible triples is **O(N^3)** time, as N is only 100, this will pass in time

> ## Memory Limmit
>> having an array of 100 integers is sufficient for this problem

> ## Data Types
>> having an integer data type is sufficient for this problem
