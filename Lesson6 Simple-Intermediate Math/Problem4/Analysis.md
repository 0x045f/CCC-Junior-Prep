# Analysis
> This question is basically asking us to find the exterior angle of a polygon given the amount of sides of the polygon.
> Keep in mind that the exterior angle of any polygon is 360 degreesÂ°.
> Remember to round the final answer to 6 decimal places.
## Time Complexity
> Becuase the time complexity for any number "N" is constant, the the program will run in O(1) time.
## Memory Limit
> There is close to no memory being used, the only object being stored is the initial integer "N".
## Data Types
> This question does not involve any data types but will require the manipulation of double (decimal) and the decimal formating function printf().
