# Analysis
> Let t1 be the time it takes for the stone to hit the bottom of the well. The remaining time taken by the sound to climb back up is t-t1. 
> Let the depth of the well be x.
> You will get x = (gt1<sup>2</sup>)/2 and x = c(t-t1)
> Solving the equation for (x) will give you the depth of the well
> The velocity as the stone hits the water is gt1

## Time Complexity
> The time complexity will be O(1) time and will run under the time complexity

## Memory Limit
> The program will only storing 3 values and will not exceed the maximum memory limit

## Data Types
> A double data type is sufficient
