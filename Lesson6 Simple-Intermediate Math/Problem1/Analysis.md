# Analysis
> this question is basically askings for the smallest mode, implement a frequency array to find it

> ## Time Complexity
>> the frequency array runs **O(N)** time, which will pass under the time limit

> ## Memory Limit
>> **O(T)**, where T is biggest number in the array, since a frequency array has this property, this will pass under the memory limit

> ## Data Types
>> A integer data type is sufficient for this problem
