# Analysis
> Bascially find the substring ```CCC```, using ```brute force``` or ```built-in``` methods are both fine
> ## Time Complexity
>> O(N<sup>3</sup>) or O(L1 * L2), depending on which methods you are using, both pass the time limit

> ## Memory Limit
>> Both methods will pass the memory limit
