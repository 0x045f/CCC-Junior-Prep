# IDE
> an IDE is an complier where you definitely need for contests like the CCC
> ### So what to download?

>> ### Python
>>> just click the download button on this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the steps after it downloads

>> ### Java
>>> I strongly recommend [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), but IDE's like [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) 
and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) are also good. For eclipse, just download the **64 bit** version.

>> ### C++
>>> sources like [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) or [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) are fine

# Lets Get Started!
> After downloading an IDE, lets get started with some problems
> First register an account on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) or [WCIPEG](https://wcipeg.com/main) to start, I'll be mostly using questions from DMOJ
> After Registering an account, first try this problem to get use to the judge
> ## DMOJ
>> [A plus B](https://dmoj.ca/problem/aplusb)
> ## WCIPEG
>> [A plus B](https://wcipeg.com/problem/aplusb)

# Next Steps
> Welcome to the prep, I will be talking about the topics that you _Potientially_ need   
> They will be in no particular order, with most of them being equally important

# Topics

> ## 1. Simple to Intermediate Math
>> A common knowledge of math is required, for example **mean, median, and mode** and **geometric formulas** like area of shapes.   
>> Assume that a level of **Grade 7 - 8** Canadian curriculum math is required

> ## 2. Binary Search
>> A powerful search algorithm that is can be seen in J4 or J5, but mostly senior problems, but still an essential skill to learn   
>> May be applicable to many different variations of the general algorithm

> ## 3. Time Complexity & Analysis
>> Knowing how long your program will run is essential when seeing if your program will run under the time limit and see if your solution
>> the problem is the intended solution  
>> The big **'O'** notation
>> Know what to do for each problem

> ## 4. Simple String Algorithms
>> Some simple search and compare algorithms will be needed

> ## 5. Sorting
>> [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)   
>> Sorting Objects **(OOP)**

> ## 6. Object Orientated Programming (OOP)
>> Talking about how to make your own data type to aid you in your programs   
>> Sorting with Objects

> ## 7. Simple Recursion
>> A general understanding of Recursion and _Possibly_ DP (dyanmic programming)   
>> Might be needed for J4 or J5

> ## 8. Simple Graph Theory
>> [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)   
>> [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFS)   
>> [Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))   
>> [Cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory))

> ## 9. Logic 
>> Some simple logic tricks and observations that you might need or want on the CCC   
>> logic is a powerful tool that you have to use alot on the CCC

> ## 10. Debugging & Syntax
>> How to debug your code  
>> [Rubber Ducking Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)   
>> Common syntax errors

# Final Step
> I will use alot of sources from different websites, I will put links wherever I can, if you have any questions, concerns, or 
> anything I can change, comment or make a pull request whenever you feel like it :p   
> Now, you have seen what we are going to do, lets get started   
> ## Lets Begin Our Journey!
